# MudBlazDx
An experiment mixing MudBlazor with 3rd party components such as DevExpress in a Blazor Server application.

## Overview
The solution is based on a vanilla MudBlazor implementation.  I added the DevExpress Blazor nuget, and added a custom css based loosely on the Material Design pattern from https://bootswatch.com/
